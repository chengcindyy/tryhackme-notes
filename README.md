# TryHackMe Notes

This repo includes notes, summaries, and walkthroughs from my TryHackMe learning journey.

My main focus is on building practical cybersecurity knowledge, especially in Blue Team topics like log analysis, SIEM, incident response, and threat hunting. All rooms are completed by me, and I use this space to track what I’ve learned and reflect on key takeaways.

> I'm currently shifting into cybersecurity, so this is where I keep track of what I'm practicing and how I'm improving.
